# Quranic Quest Mobile App UI Mockups

This directory contains UI mockups for the Quranic Quest mobile application, an AI-driven Quran learning app designed specifically for Muslim immigrant families in Western countries.

## Mockup Structure

The mockups are organized by user flow and feature category:

- **Authentication**: Login, signup, and onboarding screens
- **Dashboard**: Main app dashboard and progress tracking
- **Learning**: Lesson interfaces, pronunciation practice, and interactive content
- **Profile**: User profile and preference management
- **Family**: Family account management and parent oversight features

## Design System

The mockups follow a consistent design system with:

- **Color Palette**: Modern purple/blue primary colors (#5D5FEF) with blue accent colors (#00C2FF)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts optimized for both Arabic and Latin scripts
- **Components**: Reusable UI components that will translate to the React Native implementation
- **Iconography**: Consistent icon style throughout the application

## Key User Flows

1. **Onboarding Flow**: Initial user setup and assessment
2. **Daily Learning Flow**: Regular lesson and practice sessions
3. **Progress Review Flow**: Tracking achievements and improvements
4. **Family Management Flow**: Parent-child account interactions

## Implementation Notes

These mockups will serve as the foundation for the React Native implementation, with the AI components being developed in Python using API calls to LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic models).
