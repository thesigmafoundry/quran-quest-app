# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Quranic Quest mobile application. The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the app to ensure consistent quality and streamlined releases.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Source Control
- **Repository**: GitHub
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch for features
  - `feature/*`: Feature development branches
  - `release/*`: Release candidate branches
  - `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

### 2. Continuous Integration

#### Build Automation
- **Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Trigger**: Push to any branch, Pull Request to develop/main
- **Tasks**:
  - Install dependencies
  - Lint code
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration tests
  - Build app for Android and iOS

#### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, TypeScript
- **Test Coverage**: Jest
- **Code Review**: Required for all PRs to develop/main

### 3. Testing

#### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest
- **Integration Tests**: React Native Testing Library
- **E2E Tests**: Detox

#### Manual Testing
- **Beta Testing**: TestFlight (iOS), Google Play Beta (Android)
- **Device Testing**: Test on physical devices before release

### 4. Continuous Deployment

#### Development Builds
- **Trigger**: Merge to develop branch
- **Destination**: Internal testing group
- **Frequency**: After each feature completion

#### Beta Builds
- **Trigger**: Merge to release/* branch
- **Destination**: Beta testers
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly

#### Production Builds
- **Trigger**: Manual approval after release testing
- **Destination**: App Store and Google Play
- **Frequency**: Monthly

### 5. Infrastructure

#### Backend Deployment
- **Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Environment**: AWS (or selected cloud provider)
- **Strategy**: Blue-Green deployment

#### Database Migrations
- **Approach**: Automated with rollback capability
- **Timing**: Run before backend deployment

### 6. Monitoring

#### App Performance
- **Crash Reporting**: Firebase Crashlytics
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics
- **Performance**: Firebase Performance Monitoring

#### Backend Monitoring
- **Logs**: CloudWatch
- **Alerts**: Set up for critical errors and performance thresholds

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Development**:
   - Developer creates feature branch from develop
   - Implements feature with tests
   - Pushes to remote repository

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - CI pipeline runs on push
   - Builds app and runs tests
   - Reports status on GitHub

3. **Code Review**:
   - Developer creates PR to develop
   - Automated checks run
   - Team reviews code
   - Merge when approved

4. **Development Deployment**:
   - Merged code triggers development build
   - App deployed to internal testers
   - Backend deployed to development environment

5. **Release Preparation**:
   - Create release branch from develop
   - Final testing and bug fixes
   - Version bump and changelog update

6. **Beta Deployment**:
   - Release branch triggers beta build
   - App deployed to beta testers
   - Collect feedback and fix issues

7. **Production Deployment**:
   - Manual approval process
   - Build production version
   - Deploy to app stores
   - Deploy backend to production
   - Tag release in repository

## Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Beta testing feedback addressed
- [ ] Version numbers updated
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] App store assets prepared
- [ ] Marketing materials ready
- [ ] Backend infrastructure scaled appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Rollback Procedure

1. **App Issues**:
   - Identify severity of issue
   - For critical issues, submit expedited hotfix
   - For major issues, revert to previous version in app stores

2. **Backend Issues**:
   - Revert to previous deployment
   - Roll back database migrations if necessary
   - Notify users of temporary service disruption

## Future Improvements

- Implement automated UI testing
- Add performance regression testing
- Expand device testing matrix
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automate more of the release process
